HTML-CSS
The word NERD to me means having a true passion for something. Something that you
think about and it just gets the juices flowing.
This project is a project that came to me one day while driving to work.
The website will contain different areas for those to feed their inner NERD.

This project will start out as just HTML with CSS and eventually move to use Javascript.
A little learning will take place along the way.
